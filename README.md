- Define Your Goal & Audience
- What’s the core purpose? Streaming platform, review hub, portfolio of your films, news/blog or a mix?
- Who are your users? Casual browsers, cinephiles, filmmakers, critics—each demands different features and tone.
- Sketch Out Your Features & Content
- Browsing & Discovery: genre filters, carousels (“Top Rated,” “New Releases,” “By Decade”), search bar with autocomplete
- Detail Pages: poster art, trailer embed, synopsis, cast & crew, ratings, user comments, social-share buttons
- User Accounts (optional): watchlists, favourites, custom reviews, rating history
- Extras: editor’s picks, blog posts, interviews, event calendar, newsletter signup
- Architect Your Site

- Map out your key templates (home, list, detail, profile, blog)
- Wireframes & User Flows
- Block out pages in grayscale: where the hero goes, poster grid, filters, CTAs
- Chart a typical journey: landing → browse → filter → detail → “add to watchlist” or “watch trailer”
- Visual Design
- Theme: dark mode is popular for “cinema vibe,” with vibrant poster thumbnails
- Typography: bold headlines (e.g. Oswald, Montserrat), clean body font (e.g. Open Sans)
- Color palette: use accent colors for buttons/highlights (e.g. crimson “Play,” teal “Add to List”)
- Imagery: large, high-res poster art; subtle hover animations; trailer video previews on hover
- Prototype & Usability Testing
- Build a clickable prototype (Figma, Adobe XD) to test navigation and visual hierarchy
- Gather feedback: can users find a movie in three clicks? Does the play button stand out?
- Choose Your Tech Stack
- Frontend: React/Vue with a design system (Tailwind, Material UI) for reusable components
- Backend & CMS: Strapi, Sanity or WordPress + headless plugin for reviews and blog content
- Video Delivery: HTML5 player + HLS/DASH or embed from Vimeo/YouTube; consider JW Player for DRM
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user data, reviews, watchlists
- Hosting/CDN: Vercel/Netlify for frontend; Heroku/DigitalOcean/AWS for API; Cloudflare CDN
- Performance & SEO
- Lazy-load images (posters), defer offscreen video embeds
- Preload critical assets (hero image, CSS) for faster first paint
- Schema.org Metadata: Movie, Review, Rating tags so Google shows rich results
- Friendly URLs: /movies/inception-2010/ rather than /?id=123
- Launch & Iterate
- Set up analytics (Google Analytics, Hotjar) to see scroll depth, click maps
- A/B test homepage layouts, call-to-action labels (“Watch Trailer” vs “Play Clip”)
- Roll out new features in beta (e.g. social-login, AI-driven recommendations)
Next Steps & Questions for You
- What’s your top priority? Visual polish, deep content (reviews), or smooth video streaming?
- Are you building solo or with a team—do you need low-code tools?
- Any must-have integrations? (e.g., TMDb API for movie data, Stripe for subscriptions)
